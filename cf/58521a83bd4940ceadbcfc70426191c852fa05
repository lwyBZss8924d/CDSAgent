Phase: Thread-21 Dead Code Warning Fix
Status: ✅ WARNINGS ELIMINATED
Files: 2 files (+14/-5 lines)

Fix Summary:
- Made classifier module fully feature-gated (5 #[cfg] guards added)
- Fixed test_synthesize_content to not require script existence
- Eliminated all 3 dead code warnings in default build
- Maintained 100% test pass rate (23/23 without feature, 28/28 with feature)

Verification:
- cargo check: Zero warnings (both modes)
- cargo test: All tests passing (both modes)
- Compilation time: <1s (both modes)

Impact: Zero runtime cost when feature disabled
