WORK SESSION 04 - THREADS 01-0X SUMMARY
================================================================================

Task: T-02-02-sparse-index - Sparse Index - Name/ID + BM25 Search
Date: 2025-11-01
Session: 04 (Day 2 AM - Phase 2 Planning & Prep)
Threads: 01-07 (to be enumerated)
Start Time: 01:39 UTC
End Time: 12:45 UTC
Duration: ~? h (running)
Status: ðŸš§ AWAITING TASKS-SESSION-CODE-REVIEW & TASKS-CHECKPOINT-WORKFLOW

Session Overview:
Phase 2 / Day 2 kickoff â€” re-analyze specs, lock tokenizer/BM25 plan, and queue implementation threads.

Objectives:
- Review refreshed metadata, specs, and task trackers for remaining Phase 2-5 scope.
- Capture concrete TODO list for Phase 2 (Tokenizer) and Phase 3 (BM25) execution.
- Identify research gaps (LocAgent tokenizer rules, Tantivy schema, parity fixtures) and assign follow-up actions.
- Update planning artifacts to keep Session 04 aligned with checkpoint workflow.

================================================================================
THREAD 01: Phase 2 Planning & Spec Alignment
================================================================================
Time: 01:39-02:04 UTC
Status: âœ… COMPLETE

Objective:
- Synthesize next-phase requirements from metadata, issues, and PRDs; produce actionable TODO list for Phase 2 execution threads.

Actions:
- Reviewed `metadata.yaml` to confirm Phase 1 completion stats and outstanding acceptance criteria (BM25, overlap@10).
- Re-read Sub-Issue 02.02 and PRD-02 Â§2.2 to extract tokenizer, BM25, and hierarchical search expectations.
- Scanned LocAgent references (`plugins/location_tools/retriever/bm25_retriever.py`, `repo_index/index/epic_split.py`, requirements.txt) to understand stemming, chunking, and analyzer dependencies.
- Drafted Session 04 TODO roster covering tokenizer parity, Tantivy schema, hierarchical search merge logic, and parity harness design.
- Logged planning progress and checklist into session notes.

Key Decisions:
- Phase 2 scope will implement a dedicated Rust tokenizer mirroring LocAgent casing/underscore splits, stop-word trimming, and English stemming (Hunter Stemmer via PyStemmer equivalent).
- Tantivy will be configured with a custom analyzer pipeline (lowercase â†’ code-aware split â†’ ASCII fold â†’ Porter stem) to align with LocAgent BM25 behavior.
- Parity harness will reuse the 50-query fixture from `tests/fixtures/parity/golden_outputs/search_queries.jsonl` with overlap@10 metric and benchmarking scripted via Criterion.

Code Changes:
- None (planning thread).

Testing:
- Not applicable.

================================================================================
THREAD 02: Tokenizer Parity Analysis & Design
================================================================================
Time: 02:05-02:13 UTC
Status: âœ… COMPLETE

Objective:
- Reverse-engineer LocAgentâ€™s tokenizer/BM25 preprocessing pipeline and draft the concrete Rust implementation plan.

Actions:
- Reviewed PRD-02 Â§2.2 and PRD-06 Â§2.2 for prescribed camel/snake splitting, stop-word removal, and stemming requirements.
- Inspected LocAgent modules: `build_bm25_index.py`, `plugins/location_tools/retriever/bm25_retriever.py`, and `repo_index/index/epic_split.py` to map their BM25 build path (EpicSplitter â†’ Stemmer).
- Noted dependency on `Stemmer.Stemmer("english")` and huggingface `tokenizers` stop-word vocab; identified need to export LocAgentâ€™s stop-word list into fixtures for parity.
- Defined tokenizer pipeline steps (normalize â†’ identifier split â†’ stop-word filter â†’ Porter stem) and outlined supporting Rust crates (`regex`, `unicode-normalization`, `rust-stemmers`).
- Documented next actions in session notes/TODOs (stop-word extraction script, parity fixtures, analyzer configuration, hierarchical merge logic).

Key Decisions:
- Implement tokenizer as deterministic Rust pipeline with fixture-driven stop-word list to guarantee parity with LocAgent.
- Use `rust-stemmers` Porter stemmer; validate against LocAgent outputs via golden fixtures before integrating with Tantivy.
- Configure Tantivy analyzer to reuse tokenizer pipeline (custom token filter) instead of default tokenizers to avoid drift.

Code Changes:
- Pending.

Testing:
- Pending.

================================================================================
THREAD 03: Tokenizer Module Scaffolding
================================================================================
Time: 02:14-02:22 UTC
Status: âœ… COMPLETE

Objective:
- Implement tokenizer module skeleton, stop-word fixture plumbing, and initial unit tests that exercise normalization/splitting behavior.

Actions:
- Added `crates/cds-index/src/index/tokenizer.rs` with normalization â†’ identifier split â†’ stemming pipeline.
- Wired module export through `index/mod.rs`; introduced workspace dependencies (`unicode-normalization`, `rust-stemmers`).
- Implemented helper functions for camel/snake splitting and Unicode folding; ensured configurable stop word set.
- Authored unit tests covering camel/snake cases, stop-word filtering, unicode normalization, digit/uppercase handling.
- Ran `cargo test -p cds-index tokenizer -- --nocapture` (PASS).

Key Decisions:
- Digit sequences remain separate tokens (e.g., `http` + `2`) to mirror LocAgent regex behavior; stemming applied post-split.
- Stop-word handling left data-driven (HashSet injection) enabling parity fixture swap later.
- Tokenizer returns stemmed tokens; raw identifier split accessible via helper for future Tantivy analyzer integration.

Code Changes:
- `Cargo.toml` (workspace + crate) â€” added text-processing dependencies.
- `crates/cds-index/src/index/mod.rs` â€” exported tokenizer module.
- `crates/cds-index/src/index/tokenizer.rs` â€” new implementation + tests.

Testing:
- `cargo test -p cds-index tokenizer -- --nocapture`

================================================================================
THREAD 04: Stop-Word Fixtures & Parity Harness Prep
================================================================================
Time: 02:22-02:46 UTC
Status: âœ… COMPLETE

Objective:
- Stand up fixture-backed stop-word loading and integration tests to unblock parity validation work.

Actions:
- Added `tests/fixtures/parity/tokenizer/stop_words.txt` mirrored from LocAgentâ€™s English stop list.
- Implemented `tests/support/mod.rs` loader returning a normalized `HashSet<String>` for reuse.
- Authored `tests/tokenizer_fixture_tests.rs` to assert fixture-driven pruning and edge cases.
- Re-ran tokenizer unit tests (`cargo test -p cds-index tokenizer -- --nocapture`) to confirm coverage.

Key Decisions:
- Treat stop-word fixture as canonical source for parity to simplify future updates.
- Keep loader in `tests/support` to share logic with forthcoming parity harness utilities.

Testing:
- `cargo test -p cds-index tokenizer -- --nocapture`

================================================================================
THREAD 05: Tantivy Analyzer Integration & Offset Plumbing
================================================================================
Time: 02:47-03:30 UTC
Status: âœ… COMPLETE

Objective:
- Extend tokenizer to capture byte offsets, expose Tantivy-compatible adapter, and register custom analyzer hooks.

Actions:
- Refactored `tokenizer.rs` to emit `TokenizedToken` with offsets, added `tokenize_with_offsets`, and preserved stemmed output.
- Implemented `TantivyCodeTokenizer` and `CodeTokenStream` bridging to `tantivy::tokenizer::Tokenizer`.
- Added `AnalyzerConfig`, `register_code_analyzer`, and `CODE_ANALYZER_NAME` in `bm25.rs` for analyzer registration.
- Exported analyzer utilities via `index/mod.rs` and re-exported `TokenizedToken`/`TantivyCodeTokenizer`.
- Expanded tests: offset preservation, Tantivy stream parity, analyzer registration (`TokenizerManager` integration).
- Ran `cargo fmt` and `cargo test -p cds-index tokenizer -- --nocapture`.

Key Decisions:
- Preserve normalized byte offsets for downstream highlight support while allowing stemmed tokens for scoring.
- Register analyzer via dedicated constant (`cds_code`) to keep schema wiring deterministic.

Testing:
- `cargo test -p cds-index tokenizer -- --nocapture`

================================================================================
THREAD 06: BM25 Index Scaffold & Stop-Word Export Automation
================================================================================
Time: 11:15-12:05 UTC
Status: âœ… COMPLETE

Objective:
- Implement Tantivy-backed BM25 index skeleton and automate stop-word fixture synchronization with LocAgent.

Actions:
- Reviewed LocAgent BM25 tooling plus PRD FR-HI-2 to lock schema layout, scoring parameters (k1=1.5/b=0.75), and highlight expectations.
- Implemented `Bm25Index` with directory create/open helpers, analyzer registration, bulk ingestion, and query execution with `QueryParser`.
- Added `Bm25Document`, `SearchResult`, and `AnalyzerConfig` structs while persisting the tokenizer for matched-term extraction.
- Authored `scripts/export_stop_words.py` to pull LocAgent's `STOPWORDS_EN_PLUS` list and refreshed the parity fixture.
- Added unit tests for indexing/search and kind-filter behavior; ran tokenizer/BM25 suites.

Key Decisions:
- Store BM25 content with `IndexRecordOption::WithFreqsAndPositions` to support future snippet/highlighting.
- Reuse CDS tokenizer for both indexing and querying to prevent drift and simplify matched-term reporting.
- Automate stop-word exports to avoid manual fixture upkeep.

Testing:
- `cargo test -p cds-index tokenizer -- --nocapture`
- `cargo test -p cds-index bm25 -- --nocapture`
- `./scripts/export_stop_words.py`

================================================================================
THREAD 07: BM25 Persistence & Benchmark Planning
================================================================================
Time: 12:25-12:45 UTC
Status: âœ… COMPLETE

Objective:
- Define persistence layout, rebuild workflow, and benchmarking plan required for Phase 3 acceptance.

Actions:
- Mapped out persistence workflow: `create -> replace_documents -> commit -> reload` plus rebuild/clear steps, noting required CLI/config wiring.
- Reviewed PRD FR-GS-1 and LocAgent `BM25_index` artifacts to align directory structure (`indices/bm25/`, `meta.json`, segment layout).
- Drafted benchmarking approach (SWE-bench lite subset, 50-query parity set, latency/hit-rate metrics) to validate BM25 performance once integrated.
- Captured actionable TODOs for Phase 3 kickoff:
  - [ ] Implement `bm25::Builder` with create/open/clear API and wire `BM25_INDEX_DIR` config.
  - [ ] Add CLI command to rebuild BM25 index and surface progress/metrics.
  - [ ] Author `benches/search_bench.rs` BM25 scenario + JSON report for latency.
  - [ ] Prototype snippet/highlight extraction using stored positions.

Key Decisions:
- Align with LocAgent directory schema (`indices/bm25/`, `meta.json`) and reuse Tantivy segment layout for parity.
- Gate benchmarks on SWE-bench lite subset with shared 50-query fixture; record latency (p50/p95), overlap@10, and throughput metrics.
- Require service/CLI rebuild command to persist BM25 state and emit structured benchmark reports.

Testing:
- (Planning thread; no code changes to execute.)

================================================================================
SESSION NOTES
================================================================================

Planning Checklist:
- [x] Review metadata acceptance matrix for remaining criteria.
- [x] Extract tokenizer requirements from LocAgent + PRD-02/06.
- [x] Document Tantivy/BM25 schema + index storage expectations.
- [x] Outline parity validation strategy (overlap@10 â‰¥90%).
- [x] Update TODO roster for Session 04 implementation threads.

Open Risks to Monitor:
- Validate automated stop-word export across environments (LocAgent env availability).
- Finalize BM25 persistence/rebuild workflow and benchmark coverage before Phase 3 deliverables.
- Design snippet/highlighting flow leveraging stored positions for BM25 results.
