## Work Completed

### Thread 01: Phase 2 Planning & Spec Alignment (01:39-02:04 UTC, ~25 min)

**Objective**: Synthesize next-phase requirements from metadata, issues, and PRDs; produce actionable TODO list for Phase 2 execution threads

**Actions**:

- Parsed `metadata.yaml`, Sub-Issue 02.02, and PRD-02/06 to extract remaining acceptance criteria and phase scope.
- Inspected LocAgent code (`plugins/location_tools/retriever/bm25_retriever.py`, `repo_index/index/epic_split.py`) to understand tokenization, stemming, and chunking pipeline.
- Compiled actionable TODOs for Phase 2/3 (stop-word export, tokenizer.rs design, Tantivy analyzer schema, parity harness, hierarchical merge logic).
- Updated session notes/worklog checklists to reflect completed planning tasks and risks.

**Key Decisions**:

- Tokenizer pipeline will mirror LocAgent: lowercase + ASCII fold → identifier split → stop-word filter → Porter stemming; backed by fixtures for parity.
- BM25 integration will use Tantivy with a custom analyzer (lowercase → code-aware splitter → folding → stemming) and configurable index directory via `TANTIVY_DATA_DIR`.
- Parity harness will reuse the 50-query LocAgent fixture to measure overlap@10 once BM25 is in place.

### Thread 02: Tokenizer Parity Analysis & Design (02:05-02:13 UTC, ~8 min)

**Objective**: Reverse-engineer LocAgent tokenizer + BM25 preprocessing and lock the Rust implementation plan.

**Actions**:

- Revisited PRD-02/06 and Sub-Issue 02.02 to enumerate tokenizer, BM25, and hierarchical search requirements.
- Examined LocAgent Python references (`build_bm25_index.py`, `plugins/location_tools/retriever/bm25_retriever.py`, `repo_index/index/epic_split.py`) to map normalization, splitting, and stemming behavior.
- Captured actionable TODO items (stop-word export, Tantivy analyzer plan, parity harness) in Session 04 notes.

**Key Decisions**:

- Maintain ASCII-folded, stemmed token stream aligned with LocAgent’s `Stemmer.Stemmer("english")`.
- Export stop-word list from LocAgent environment into repo fixtures for deterministic parity.
- Build Tantivy analyzer atop the Rust tokenizer to avoid divergence between indexing and search pipelines.

### Thread 03: Tokenizer Module Scaffolding (02:14-02:22 UTC, ~8 min)

**Objective**: Implement tokenizer.rs skeleton, stop-word plumbing, and unit tests.

**Actions**:

- Added tokenizer module (normalize → camel/snake split → stop-word filter → Porter stem) with configurable stop-word set.
- Updated workspace and crate Cargo manifests for `unicode-normalization` and `rust-stemmers`.
- Wrote unit tests covering camel/snake tokens, unicode accent folding, stop-word pruning, and uppercase/digit segmentation.
- Executed `cargo test -p cds-index tokenizer -- --nocapture` (pass).

**Key Decisions**:

- Keep alphanumeric/digit boundary tokens separate (e.g., `http`, `2`) matching LocAgent regex behavior.
- Provide helper APIs to reuse tokenizer pipeline in forthcoming Tantivy analyzer implementation.
- Continue to defer stop-word fixture extraction and parity comparisons to dedicated follow-up tasks.

### Thread 04: Stop-Word Fixtures & Parity Harness Prep (02:22-02:46 UTC, ~24 min)

**Objective**: Provide fixture-backed stop-word loading and prepare parity utilities/tests.

**Actions**:

- Added stop-word fixture at `crates/cds-index/tests/fixtures/parity/tokenizer/stop_words.txt` and loader helper (`tests/support/mod.rs`).
- Wrote integration test `tokenizer_fixture_tests.rs` validating fixture-sourced stop-word pruning.
- Re-ran tokenizer unit tests (`cargo test -p cds-index tokenizer -- --nocapture`).

**Key Outcomes**:

- Fixture + loader infrastructure ready for Phase 5 parity harness.
- Confirmed tokenizer pipeline interoperates with fixture stop words via integration test.

### Thread 05: Tantivy Analyzer Integration & Offset Plumbing (02:47-03:30 UTC, ~43 min)

**Objective**: Extend tokenizer to capture byte offsets, expose Tantivy-compatible adapter, and register custom analyzer hooks.

**Actions**:

- Refactored `tokenizer.rs` to emit `TokenizedToken`, added `tokenize_with_offsets`, and preserved stemmed output semantics.
- Implemented `TantivyCodeTokenizer`/`CodeTokenStream` adapters and `Tokenizer::to_text_analyzer`.
- Introduced `AnalyzerConfig`, `register_code_analyzer`, and `CODE_ANALYZER_NAME` in `bm25.rs`; re-exported helpers via `index/mod.rs`.
- Expanded tests covering offset preservation, Tantivy parity, analyzer registration, and fixture stop-word flow.
- Ran `cargo fmt` and `cargo test -p cds-index tokenizer -- --nocapture`.

**Key Outcomes**:

- Custom analyzer wiring ready for Tantivy schema registration with deterministic name `cds_code`.
- Token offsets retained for future highlighting while keeping stemmed tokens for scoring.

### Thread 06: BM25 Index Scaffold, Stop-Word Export & Search API (11:15-12:05 UTC, ~50 min)

**Objective**: Implement Tantivy-backed BM25 index module and expose search/query APIs leveraging the shared tokenizer.

**Actions**:

- Reviewed LocAgent BM25 specs (FR-HI-2) and Python pipeline to capture schema fields, scoring params (k1=1.5/b=0.75), and highlight expectations.
- Implemented `Bm25Index`, `Bm25Document`, `SearchResult`, and `AnalyzerConfig`; wired analyzer registration via `register_code_analyzer`.
- Added index creation/open helpers, replace_documents ingestion, and BM25 search with optional `NodeKind` filtering + matched-term extraction.
- Persisted CDS tokenizer inside BM25 index to reuse query normalization/matched term logic; ensured content stored with positions for future snippets.
- Authored `scripts/export_stop_words.py` to pull LocAgent BM25 stop words into the parity fixture and ran the exporter.
- Added unit tests (`bm25_index_creates_and_searches`, `bm25_respects_kind_filter`) and ran `cargo test -p cds-index bm25 -- --nocapture`.

**Key Outcomes**:

- BM25 backend skeleton ready for Phase 3 integration (index build, hierarchical orchestration).
- Search results now include matched terms derived from tokenizer parity, aligning with highlight requirements.
- Stop-word fixture now generated automatically from LocAgent’s bm25s list, reducing drift.

### Thread 07: BM25 Persistence & Benchmark Planning (12:25-12:45 UTC, ~20 min)

**Objective**: Define persistence layout, rebuild workflow, and benchmarking plan needed for BM25 acceptance criteria.

**Actions**:

- Reviewed PRD FR-GS-1 and LocAgent BM25 index artifacts to align directory structure (`indices/bm25/`, metadata files).
- Outlined configuration knobs (`BM25_INDEX_DIR`, retention strategy) and rebuild workflow (create vs open, delete/refresh cycles).
- Drafted benchmarking checklist covering dataset scope (SWE-bench lite subset), query suite, latency metrics, and tooling ownership.

**Key Outcomes**:

- Draft plan captured in session notes to seed Phase 3 implementation tasks and benchmarking scripts.
