# Work Summary - 2025-10-31

**Task**: T-02-02-sparse-index - Sparse Index - Name/ID + BM25 Search
**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Author**: Claude Code Agent + Rust Dev 2

---

## Today's Objectives

- [x] Initialize T-02-02 worktree and task artifacts
- [x] Update project documentation to reflect M2 milestone progress
- [x] Sync AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md with current status
- [ ] Begin Phase 1: Upper Index - Name/ID HashMap design

## Work Completed

### Documentation Updates

- **AGENTS.md**: Added 2025-10-31 status snapshot with T-02-01 completion, T-02-02 kickoff, and updated repository structure showing modular graph builder
- **CLAUDE.md**: Mirrored AGENTS.md updates for AI assistant context
- **README.md**: Added comprehensive status section, updated features with parity results, refreshed project tree, marked roadmap items
- **Issue files**: Updated 01-graph-build.md with completion notes, 02-sparse-index.md with in-progress status

### Key Decisions

1. **Decision**: Document M2 milestone transition before starting code implementation
   - **Rationale**: Ensures all team members and AI assistants have current context
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Update documentation after code completion
   - **Trade-offs**: Small upfront time investment for better clarity throughout development

## Code Changes

### Files Modified

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1

**Problem**: Need to maintain consistency across multiple documentation files
**Solution**: Created systematic status snapshot section in AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, and README.md
**References**: M2 milestone in spacs/tasks/0.1.0-mvp/TODO.yaml

## Next Steps

- [ ] Commit documentation updates
- [ ] Begin Upper Index design and implementation
- [ ] Set up benchmark framework in crates/cds-index/benches/search_bench.rs
- [ ] Review LocAgent BM25 implementation for parity reference

## Acceptance Criteria Progress

- [ ] Upper index (name/ID HashMap) with prefix matching (not started)
- [ ] Lower index (BM25 k1=1.5, b=0.75) (not started)
- [ ] Search latency <500ms p95 (not started)
- [ ] Index build <5s for 1K files (not started)
- [ ] Search overlap@10 â‰¥90% on 50 queries (not started)
- [ ] Unit test coverage >95% (not started)

## Notes & Comments

Task initialization went smoothly. Documentation updates establish clear context for M2 milestone work. Ready to begin implementation once this checkpoint is committed.

Dependencies clear: T-02-01 merged (PR #6) provides graph builder foundation needed for indexing.
