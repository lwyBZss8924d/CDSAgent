# Work Summary - 2025-10-19

**Task**: T-05-01-jsonrpc-schema - JSON-RPC Schema Definition & Validation
**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Author**: Claude Code Agent

---

## Today's Objectives

- [x] Review newly drafted JSON-RPC documentation and schema artifacts
- [x] Inspect associated PRDs, issues, and task specs for alignment
- [x] Capture gaps/blockers for implementation team

## Work Completed

### Documentation & Spec Review

- Audited docs/api/README.md, error-codes.md, versioning.md, and jsonrpc-schema.json against PRD-05 requirements.
- Verified task registry (spacs/tasks/0.1.0-mvp/TODO.yaml) and Issue-05 scope for consistency with deliverables.
- Read new Rust contract tests and API fixtures to understand intended validation coverage.

## Code Changes

### Files Modified

- No code committed today; review-only session.

### Key Decisions

1. **Decision**: Flagged schema validation gaps instead of attempting partial fixes.
   - **Rationale**: Implementation owners should choose between schemars-based generation or runtime jsonschema validation.
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Quick manual assertions in tests (insufficient for acceptance criteria).
   - **Trade-offs**: Slower short-term progress, but clearer accountability for contract enforcement.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1

**Problem**: Document set references future dates and incorrect relative paths, undermining trust in artifacts.
**Solution**: Logged findings for corrective action; will follow up after owners revise docs.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Author follow-up tasks to fix schema/test gaps once implementation begins.
- [ ] Align worklogs/metadata with actual progress tracking cadence.
- [ ] Confirm contract tests integrate jsonrpc-schema.json via validator crate.

## Acceptance Criteria Progress

- [ ] Schema docs published (pending revisions flagged today)
- [ ] Contract tests enforce schema (not started)
- [ ] CLI integration schema validation (not started)
- [ ] Versioning plan documented (draft under review)

## Notes & Comments

- Detailed review observations captured in git notes for branch HEAD (see git notes show).
