# Work Summary - 2025-10-23

**Task**: T-05-02-typescript-bindings — TypeScript Client Bindings & SDK Integration
**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Author**: Claude Code Agent

---

## Today's Objectives

- [x] Create strongly-typed API models with runtime validation
- [x] Implement JSON-RPC client with retry and error mapping
- [x] Add unit tests for success/error/retry scenarios
- [ ] Wire client into Claude agent hooks

## Work Completed

### Implemented Features

- Authored Zod-backed schemas covering entities, traversal results, and error payloads (cds-agent/src/types/api.ts).
- Built JSONRPCClient with configurable retries, timeout handling, and typed wrappers for search, traverse, retrieve, and rebuild endpoints (cds-agent/src/client/jsonrpc.ts).
- Wired main.ts to loadConfig() so timeout/retry/logging settings come from environment and kept log-level aware telemetry for SDK integration.

### Tests Added

- cds-agent/tests/jsonrpc-client.test.ts exercises happy-path search, JSON-RPC error mapping (index missing, query timeout), network retry flow, invalid JSON handling, and request parameter translation.
- Verified bun test (8 tests) and bun run typecheck locally; both pass.

## Code Changes

Files touched today:

- cds-agent/package.json — add zod dependency
- cds-agent/tsconfig.json — enable DOM lib for fetch typings
- cds-agent/src/types/api.ts — new schema and type exports
- cds-agent/src/client/jsonrpc.ts — new JSON-RPC client implementation
- cds-agent/tests/jsonrpc-client.test.ts — new Bun test suite
- cds-agent/src/main.ts — bootstrap client and logging hook

### Key Decisions

1. Zod-based validation: opted for manual schema definitions instead of quicktype output to keep types readable and enforce runtime guards.
2. Single-module client: combined transport, retry logic, and error mapping in jsonrpc.ts for MVP to reduce indirection; will split if complexity grows post-integration.
3. NetworkError classification: retried only network/timeout failures, leaving JSON-RPC errors to propagate immediately for clearer agent telemetry.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Ensuring retry logic does not mask JSON-RPC errors

- Problem: Initial implementation retried on every thrown error, causing unnecessary retries on server-side error codes.
- Solution: Classified errors; only NetworkError triggers backoff, while JsonRpcError/UnexpectedResponseError bubble up instantly.

### Challenge 2: Typing fetch headers without DOM lib

- Problem: TypeScript complained about HeadersInit in Bun environment.
- Solution: Enabled DOM lib in tsconfig to access standard fetch types.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Expose client through agent hooks once Claude SDK scaffolding lands.
- [ ] Add configuration helper for endpoint/timeouts sourced from environment.
- [ ] Consider lightweight mock server for integration tests once service layer is available.

## Acceptance Criteria Progress

- [x] Client methods compile and work (with ID validation)
- [x] TypeScript types align with schema
- [x] Unit tests cover success, error, and security scenarios (12 tests)
- [x] Client integrated with agent entrypoint (complete in main.ts)

## PR Review Fixes (Session 2)

### Review Finding

- **Issue**: Client wasn't validating that response IDs match request IDs
- **Severity**: P1 - Security risk (could lead to data corruption if responses arrive out of order)
- **Resolution**: Added assertMatchingId method to validate response IDs match request IDs

### Implementation

- Added `assertMatchingId` method to JSONRPCClient class
- Method validates both success and error response IDs
- Throws UnexpectedResponseError when IDs don't match
- Added test case "rejects responses with mismatched ids"

### TypeScript Configuration Fixes

- Updated tsconfig.json to include tests directory
- Changed rootDir from "./src" to "./" to support test files
- Fixed fetch mock typing issues with proper type casting
- All 12 tests now pass with clean TypeScript compilation

### Files Modified in Review

- `cds-agent/src/client/jsonrpc.ts` - Added ID validation
- `cds-agent/tests/jsonrpc-client.test.ts` - Added ID mismatch test, fixed typing
- `cds-agent/tsconfig.json` - Expanded to include tests
