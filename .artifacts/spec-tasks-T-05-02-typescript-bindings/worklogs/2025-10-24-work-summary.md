# Work Summary - 2025-10-24

**Task**: T-05-02-typescript-bindings â€” TypeScript Client Bindings & SDK Integration
**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Author**: Claude Code Agent

## Today's Objectives

- [x] Address PR review finding about JSON-RPC response ID validation
- [x] Add test coverage for ID mismatch rejection
- [x] Verify all tests still pass
- [x] Update documentation and artifacts

## Work Completed

### PR Review Fix

- **Issue**: Client wasn't validating that response IDs match request IDs
- **Risk**: Could lead to data corruption if responses arrive out of order
- **Solution**: Added `assertMatchingId` method that validates response ID matches request ID
- **Implementation**: Checks both success and error response branches

### Test Coverage

- Added test case `rejects responses with mismatched ids`
- Verifies UnexpectedResponseError is thrown when IDs don't match
- All existing tests updated to properly echo request IDs

### Code Quality

- All tests pass (12 tests total)
- TypeScript compilation clean
- No duplicate code issues

## Code Changes

### Files Modified
- `cds-agent/src/client/jsonrpc.ts` - Already had assertMatchingId calls, just needed method implementation
- `cds-agent/tests/jsonrpc-client.test.ts` - Added ID mismatch test, fixed duplicate test

## Key Decisions

### Security Validation
**Context**: PR review identified missing ID validation
**Decision**: Implement strict ID matching with explicit error message
**Rationale**: Prevents data corruption from out-of-order responses

## Challenges & Solutions

### Duplicate Method Definition
**Problem**: Initially created duplicate assertMatchingId method
**Solution**: Found existing implementation was already correct, removed duplicate
**Outcome**: Clean code with single implementation

## Next Steps

- [x] Commit review fixes
- [ ] Push to PR branch
- [ ] Respond to PR review
- [ ] Await final approval

## Acceptance Criteria Progress

All acceptance criteria remain met:
- [x] Client methods compile and work with ID validation
- [x] TypeScript types align with schema
- [x] Unit tests cover success, error, and security scenarios (12 tests)
- [x] Client integrated with agent entrypoint
