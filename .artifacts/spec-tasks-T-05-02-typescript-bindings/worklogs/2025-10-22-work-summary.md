**Task**: T-05-02-typescript-bindings â€” TypeScript Client Bindings & SDK Integration
**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Author**: Claude Code Agent

## Today's Objectives

- [x] Review T-05-02 specification and related PRDs
- [x] Verify dependency status for T-05-01-jsonrpc-schema
- [ ] Begin TypeScript client implementation

## Work Completed

### Planning & Analysis

- Read docs/api/jsonrpc-schema.json and companion README to confirm available endpoints and payloads.
- Confirmed service layer is still pending (T-02-03), so client must rely on mocked responses for early tests.

### Coordination

- Synced worktree setup instructions against WORKTREE_WORKFLOW.md to ensure metadata/worklogs are aligned before starting implementation.

## Challenges & Notes

- Awaiting confirmation that no additional endpoints will land before coding; mitigation is to keep schemas centralized.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Generate TypeScript types and validation schemas
- [ ] Implement JSON-RPC client with retry/backoff
- [ ] Add unit tests and integrate client into agent entrypoint

## Acceptance Criteria Progress

- [ ] Client methods compile and work
- [ ] TypeScript types align with schema
- [ ] Unit tests cover success + error scenarios
- [ ] Client integrated with agent entrypoint
