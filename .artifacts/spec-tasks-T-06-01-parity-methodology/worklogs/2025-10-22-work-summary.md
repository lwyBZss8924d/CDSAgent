**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Author**: Claude Code Agent

---

## Today's Objectives

- [x] Address PR #4 code review findings (HIGH + P1 issues)
- [x] Fix SC2155 shellcheck warnings
- [x] Add zero-division guards for bc calculations
- [x] Update metadata and worklogs to reflect actual progress

## Work Completed

### Bug Fixes (6 fixes across 6 commits)

1. **Metadata status alignment** (commit 23d66d8)
   - Updated metadata.yaml from "not_started" to "in_progress"
   - Added actual start date (2025-10-20), target (2025-10-23)
   - Split acceptance criteria into Phase 1 (completed) and Phase 2 (pending)
   - Tracked actual hours: 6 hours for Phase 1

2. **Multi-repo metric aggregation** (commit ff73b68)
   - Fixed crash when grep returns multiple lines with 5 repos
   - Added max aggregation for variance metrics
   - Added sum aggregation for match counts

3. **Traverse comparison logic** (commits 04dc719, 571e90a)
   - Fixed comparison of sum to constant (30 â‰  10 false failure)
   - Changed to compare exact_matches == total_scenarios (100% rate)
   - Reinstated minimum scenario threshold (â‰¥10) to prevent 1/1 passing

4. **Pipefail exit bug** (commit 47472a8)
   - Fixed silent script exit when grep "FAILED:" returns 1 (no matches)
   - Added grep -q guard before piping to while loop
   - Prevents premature termination with `set -euo pipefail`

5. **Empty directories not tracked** (commit 9749a4e)
   - Added .gitkeep files to golden_outputs/, locagent_repo/, sample_repos/
   - Auto-create directories in script if missing
   - Updated README.md to remove reference to non-existent helper script

6. **SC2155 warnings and zero-division** (commit 1c27b64)
   - Separated declare and assign for all command substitutions
   - Fixed graph, search, traverse, performance checks
   - Added zero-division guard in search check (prevents bc crash when total=0)

## Code Changes

### Files Modified

```text
scripts/parity-check.sh - Fixed 6 critical bugs across 469 lines
  - Lines 131-134: SC2155 fix for graph variance extraction
  - Lines 175-187: SC2155 + zero-division guard for search overlap
  - Lines 227-230: SC2155 fix for traverse exact matches
  - Lines 284-289: SC2155 fix for performance metrics

.artifacts/spec-tasks-T-06-01-parity-methodology/metadata.yaml
  - Updated status, dates, hours, acceptance criteria

spacs/tasks/0.1.0-mvp/06-refactor-parity/T-06-01-parity-methodology.md
  - Corrected status from "Not Started" to "In Progress"
  - Split acceptance criteria into Phase 1 (completed) and Phase 2 (pending)
```

### Key Decisions

1. **Aggregation Strategy**: Max for variance, sum for counts
   - **Rationale**: Variance measures worst-case deviation (use max), counts measure total coverage (use sum)
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Average (would hide outliers), min (too lenient)
   - **Trade-offs**: Max variance is stricter but catches edge cases

2. **Zero-Division Guard Placement**: Only in search check
   - **Rationale**: Search has highest risk of parsing failures (total=0)
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Add guards to all checks (unnecessary, other checks use integer comparison)
   - **Trade-offs**: Minimal guards reduce code complexity while protecting critical path

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Multi-Repo Metric Aggregation

**Problem**: Script designed for single repo (LocAgent self-test), but needs to handle 5 sample repos. grep returns 5 lines, breaking bc comparisons.

**Solution**: Added aggregation strategies:
- Variance: `sort -nr | head -1` (max)
- Counts: `awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum}'` (sum)

**References**:
- Original finding: User review comment "grep will return several numbers"
- PRD-06 Â§5.3: Multi-repo testing requirements

### Challenge 2: Pipefail Silent Exit

**Problem**: With `set -euo pipefail`, when all scenarios pass (no "FAILED:" lines), grep returns exit code 1, causing script to exit before printing summary.

**Solution**: Guard with `if grep -q "FAILED:" ... 2>/dev/null; then` to check for matches before piping.

**References**:
- User finding: "grep returns 1 and the pipeline terminates the whole script"
- Bash manual: pipefail behavior with grep

### Challenge 3: Branch Management Confusion

**Problem**: Committed to wrong branch (pr-4-review instead of feat/task/T-06-01-parity-methodology), creating duplicate remote branch.

**Solution**:
- Cherry-picked SC2155 fix to correct branch
- Deleted redundant pr-4-review branch (local + remote)
- Verified PR #4 updated with all 9 commits

## Next Steps

- [ ] Await PR #4 approval from Rust Lead + Tech Lead
- [ ] Begin Phase 2: Extract LocAgent baseline data for 5 sample repos
  - [ ] Select 5 repos from SWE-bench Lite (50-500 files, diverse characteristics)
  - [ ] Extract graph structure baselines (graph_*.json)
  - [ ] Create 50 search queries with expected results (search_queries.jsonl)
  - [ ] Create 10 traversal scenarios (traverse_samples.jsonl)
  - [ ] Benchmark performance baselines (perf_*.log)
- [ ] Update locagent_version.txt with LocAgent baseline version

## Acceptance Criteria Progress

### Phase 1: Documentation & Infrastructure (âœ… Completed 2025-10-20)
- [x] docs/parity-validation-methodology.md published (62KB, 9 sections)
- [x] scripts/parity-check.sh functional (469 lines, 4 check types)
- [x] Test fixtures directory structure created with .gitkeep files
- [x] locagent_version.txt tracks baseline version
- [x] Phase-gated checkpoints defined (Week 2, 5, 7, 10)

### Phase 2: Baseline Extraction (ðŸ”¨ In Progress - Target: 2025-10-23)
- [ ] Extract golden outputs for 5 SWE-bench Lite repos
- [ ] Document 50 search queries with expected top-10 results
- [ ] Document 10 traversal scenarios with expected outputs
- [ ] Capture performance baselines (index, search, traverse)

## Notes & Comments

- All HIGH and P1 review findings resolved
- Script now production-ready with proper error handling
- SC2155 compliance improves exit code propagation reliability
- Zero-division guard prevents silent failures in edge cases
- Worktree workflow effective for isolated task development
