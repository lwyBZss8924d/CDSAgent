# Review Notes - 2025-10-22

**Task**: T-06-01-parity-methodology  
**Author**: Codex Review Agent  
**Scope**: DEV-COOKING status inspection for milestone 0.1.0-MVP (PRDs, issues, tasks)

---

## Summary

- Audited parity methodology planning docs (`spacs/tasks/0.1.0-mvp/06-refactor-parity/T-06-01-parity-methodology.md`, `docs/parity-validation-methodology.md`, `spacs/issues/04-0.1.0-mvp/06-refactor-parity.md`).
- Cross-checked milestone tracking in `spacs/tasks/0.1.0-mvp/README.md` and `TODO.yaml` plus existing `.artifacts` metadata.
- Identified inconsistencies between reported status and actual deliverable readiness.
- Documented review findings, risks, and remediation suggestions.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Status misalignment** – Task spec still advertises `Status: ☐ Not Started | Week 1 (Target: 2025-10-21)` yet bottom section `Acceptance Criteria Met` is pre-checked, implying completion despite no baselines in `tests/fixtures/parity/golden_outputs/`. (Ref: `spacs/tasks/0.1.0-mvp/06-refactor-parity/T-06-01-parity-methodology.md:9` and `:214-218`)
2. **Workflow tracking lag** – `spacs/tasks/0.1.0-mvp/TODO.yaml` keeps `workflows.active_tasks` focused on T-05-01; T-06-01 is only listed under `next_up`. The task should move to `active_tasks` now that T-05-01 is complete and T-06-01 is on the critical path. (Ref: `spacs/tasks/0.1.0-mvp/TODO.yaml:826-836`)
3. **Artifact templates unfilled** – `.artifacts/spec-tasks-T-06-01-parity-methodology/worklogs/*` still contain template placeholders dated 2025-10-20, and `golden_outputs/` is empty, meaning deliverable baselines are not yet generated.
4. **Due date passed** – Target completion (2025-10-21) is now in the past (today: 2025-10-22) with no recorded start date, introducing schedule risk for downstream tasks T-02-01 and T-02-02.

## Risk Assessment

- **Schedule**: High – slipped milestone gate threatens Week 2 graph builder kickoff.
- **Quality**: Medium – unchecked acceptance state could let downstream work begin without baselines.
- **Coordination**: Medium – planning artifacts require sync to reflect the actual active thread.

## Recommendations

1. Update task spec to reflect real status (`Status: In Progress`), clear the premature `[x]` checkboxes, and capture new realistic completion date.
2. Promote T-06-01 into `workflows.active_tasks` in `TODO.yaml`, add owner + expected duration notes, and record dependency implications.
3. Replace placeholder worklogs with actual notes and begin extracting at least one sample baseline repo to unblock automation script validation.
4. Communicate the slip to the team (DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md) and re-baseline Week 1 plan before T-02-01 kicks off.

## Next Steps

- Owner acknowledgement of findings.
- Revise artifacts & schedule.
- Kick off LocAgent baseline extraction ASAP (target by 2025-10-23).
