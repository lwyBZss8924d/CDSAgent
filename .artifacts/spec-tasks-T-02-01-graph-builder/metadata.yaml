acceptance_criteria:
  - criterion: "Parses Python repositories and produces a graph with all 4 node types and 4 edge types"
    status: "in_progress"
    notes: "✅ All 4 node types implemented (directory, file, class, function). ✅ All 4 edge types implemented (contains, imports, invokes, inherits). ⏳ Needs parity validation testing."
  - criterion: "Fully-qualified names match LocAgent format (e.g., path/to/file.py::Class::method)"
    status: "in_progress"
    notes: "✅ FQN format implemented (filename:Class.method). ⏳ Needs validation against golden baselines."
  - criterion: "Unit tests cover typical and edge cases (decorators, nested classes, async functions)"
    status: "in_progress"
    notes: "✅ Initial unit tests added (2 tests for invoke edges with alias resolution). ⏳ Needs expansion to >80% coverage per TODO."
  - criterion: "Graph parity script reports ≤2% variance in node/edge counts vs. LocAgent baseline"
    status: "pending"
    notes: "⏳ Next step: Run scripts/parity-check.sh against 6 SWE-bench fixtures to validate ≤2% variance budget."
