## Current Status (Start of Day 6)

### ✅ COMPLETED Deliverables
1. **Core Implementation** (5,214 lines across 14 modules)
   - ✅ `parser.rs` (426 lines) - Tree-sitter Python integration
   - ✅ `builder/mod.rs` + submodules (3,200+ lines) - Graph construction
   - ✅ `traversal.rs` (64 lines) - BFS/DFS helpers
   - ✅ All 4 node types: Directory, File, Class, Function
   - ✅ All 4 edge types: Contain, Import, Invoke, Inherit

2. **Parity Validation** - 🟢 PASSING
   - ✅ 6/6 fixtures within ≤2% tolerance
   - ✅ locagent: 0% variance (perfect match)
   - ✅ django: 0% variance (perfect match)
   - ✅ pytest: +1.29% invokes (within tolerance)
   - ✅ All other fixtures: <1% variance

3. **FQN Format** - ✅ COMPLETE
   - Format: `filename:Class.method`
   - Validated against golden baselines

### ⚠️ IN PROGRESS
1. **Unit Tests** - 30% coverage (need >80%)
   - ✅ 8 tests existing (7 pass, 1 fail)
   - ❌ `import_edges_follow_package_reexports` FAILING
   - ⏳ Need 15-20 more tests for edge cases

### 📊 Acceptance Criteria Status
- [x] All 4 node types + 4 edge types implemented ✅
- [x] FQN format matches LocAgent ✅
- [ ] Unit tests >80% coverage ⏳ (30% → need 85%)
- [x] Parity ≤2% variance ✅ (all fixtures passing)

## Work Completed

### Pre-Session Analysis (05:05Z - 05:30Z)
- [x] Comprehensive codebase analysis via Plan agent
- [x] Reviewed all 14 graph modules (5,214 lines)
- [x] Analyzed test suite (8 unit tests + 1 integration test)
- [x] Ran latest parity validation (6/6 fixtures pass)
- [x] Identified failing test root cause
- [x] Created detailed 5-session completion plan

**Key Findings**:
- Core implementation rock-solid
- Parity validation excellent (best results: 0% variance)
- Test coverage is the main gap (30% vs >80% target)
- 1 failing test due to Day 5 refactoring regression

## Code Changes

### Files Modified Today
_(To be filled as work progresses)_

```text
crates/cds-index/tests/graph_builder_tests.rs - Add 15-20 new test cases
crates/cds-index/src/graph/builder/imports.rs - Fix re-export regression
crates/cds-index/src/graph/mod.rs - Add doc comments
.artifacts/spec-tasks-T-02-01-graph-builder/metadata.yaml - Update completion status
```

### Key Decisions
_(To be filled during execution)_

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Failing Test Regression
**Problem**: `import_edges_follow_package_reexports` failing after Day 5 grouped import changes

**Root Cause**: `process_from_import()` fallback logic for grouped imports may have regressed simple re-export handling in `pkg/__init__.py`

**Solution Plan**:
1. Debug with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` and inspect graph
2. Verify `ModuleExports` tracking for `__all__` re-exports
3. Check if grouped import fallback is interfering
4. Fix and verify test passes

**Status**: Pending (Session 1)

### Challenge 2: Test Coverage Gap
**Problem**: Current coverage ~30%, need >80% to meet acceptance criteria

**Solution**:
- Prioritize high-value test scenarios (nested structures, edge cases)
- Use template pattern for rapid test creation
- Focus on edge cases from spec (decorators, async, TYPE_CHECKING)
- Aim for 15-20 new tests (total 23-28 tests)

**Status**: In Progress (Session 1-2)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Session 1)
- [ ] Fix failing test (highest priority)
- [ ] Begin adding unit tests (batch 1: nested classes/functions)

### Session 2
- [ ] Continue unit test expansion
- [ ] Run clippy
- [ ] Add doc comments

### Session 3
- [ ] Final validation
- [ ] Update metadata
- [ ] Commit changes

### Session 4-5
- [ ] Create PR
- [ ] Submit for review
- [ ] Mark T-02-01 complete ✅

## Acceptance Criteria Progress

### ✅ Criterion 1: All Node & Edge Types (COMPLETE)
- [x] 4 node types implemented
- [x] 4 edge types implemented
- [x] Validated via parity tests
- **Evidence**: All 6 fixtures parse successfully with expected node/edge counts

### ✅ Criterion 2: FQN Format Match (COMPLETE)
- [x] Format matches `filename:Class.method`
- [x] Validated against golden baselines
- **Evidence**: Parity tests show 0% node variance on all fixtures

### ⏳ Criterion 3: Unit Test Coverage >80% (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] 8 unit tests exist
- [ ] 1 failing test (fix in progress)
- [ ] Need 15-20 more tests
- **Target**: 23+ tests total, all passing, coverage >80%

### ✅ Criterion 4: Parity ≤2% Variance (COMPLETE)
- [x] All 6 fixtures within tolerance
- [x] Best results: 0% variance (locagent, django)
- [x] Worst result: +1.29% (pytest invokes, still within tolerance)
- **Evidence**: Latest parity run 2025-10-30T05:05:31Z

## Notes & Comments

### Strengths of Current Implementation
- **Architecture**: Well-designed modular structure (14 modules)
- **Parity**: Excellent results (6/6 fixtures passing)
- **Code Quality**: Clean compilation, well-structured
- **Edge Coverage**: All major LocAgent features implemented

### Areas for Improvement
- **Test Coverage**: Primary gap (30% → need 80%+)
- **Documentation**: Missing doc comments on public API
- **Minor Regression**: 1 failing test from Day 5 changes

### Risk Assessment
- **Overall Risk**: LOW
- **Completion Confidence**: 95% (HIGH)
- **Time Buffer**: 9.5 hours after planned completion (14:30Z)
- **Blockers**: None (all dependencies met)

### Success Metrics
- **Code Written**: 8,265 lines total (Day 1-5)
- **Tests**: 8 unit + 1 integration (target: 23-28 total)
- **Parity**: 6/6 fixtures ✅
- **Time**: 34 hours actual vs 40 estimated (on track)
