## Code Changes

### Files Verified (No Changes Needed)
- docs/api/error-codes.md - Already comprehensive
- README.md - Already links to error catalogue

### Files Created
- .artifacts/spec-tasks-T-05-03-error-catalogue/metadata.yaml
- .artifacts/spec-tasks-T-05-03-error-catalogue/git-refs.txt
- .artifacts/spec-tasks-T-05-03-error-catalogue/worklogs/2025-10-24-work-summary.md
- .artifacts/spec-tasks-T-05-03-error-catalogue/worklogs/2025-10-24-commit-log.md
- .artifacts/spec-tasks-T-05-03-error-catalogue/worklogs/2025-10-24-notes.md

## Key Decisions

**Decision 1**: Minimal Scope for T-05-03
- **Rationale**: Error catalogue was already comprehensive from T-05-01
- **Action**: Focus on verification and task tracking only
- **Impact**: Reduced actual hours from 8 (estimated) to 1 (actual)

**Decision 2**: No Additional Documentation Needed
- **Rationale**: error-codes.md already covers all acceptance criteria
- **Action**: Verify completeness, no new content required
- **Impact**: Task can be marked complete immediately

---

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Task Appeared Already Complete
- **Issue**: error-codes.md was created during T-05-01, unclear what remained for T-05-03
- **Solution**: Framed T-05-03 as verification and formalization task
- **Outcome**: Confirmed all deliverables met, created tracking artifacts

---

## Next Steps

- [x] Commit task artifacts
- [x] Update TODO.yaml with M1 milestone completion
- [ ] Prepare M2 environment (T-02-01 graph builder)
