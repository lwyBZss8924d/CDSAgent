# Work Session Checkpoint - Overview & Purpose

**Part of**: [Work Session Checkpoint Workflow](../WORK_SESSION_CHECKPOINT_WORKFLOW.md)

## What is a Work Session Checkpoint?

A **Work Session Checkpoint** is the end-of-session process to ensure all task artifacts (worklogs, metadata, action logs) accurately reflect the actual development work completed, as verified against git operations.

## Why This Workflow Exists

**Problem**: During active development, artifacts can become inconsistent:

- Template files created but not filled out
- Metadata fields left as "PENDING"
- Statistics that don't match actual git changes
- Test counts or descriptions inaccurate

**Solution**: This systematic review process ensures **100% consistency** between:

- Raw action logs (source of truth for what was done)
- Git operations (source of truth for what changed)
- Task artifacts (documentation of progress)

## Relationship to Other Workflows

- **WORKTREE_WORKFLOW.md**: Defines overall task development lifecycle
  - Phase 2 (Daily Development) → leads to → **This Checkpoint Workflow** (EOD)
- **NEXT_TASK_CHECKLIST.md**: Defines task initialization
  - Task starts → Initialize artifacts → Daily dev → **Checkpoint** → Complete task

## When to Use This Workflow

### Required Checkpoints

✅ **End of Day (EOD)**

- Before closing IDE for the day
- After last commit of the session
- Ensures next day starts clean

✅ **Before Major Push**

- Before `git push origin <branch>`
- Before creating pull request
- Ensures remote artifacts are accurate

✅ **After Significant Commit**

- After implementing major feature
- After resolving complex bug
- After parity breakthrough (e.g., import variance resolved)

### Optional Checkpoints

⚪ **Mid-Day Review**

- If multiple commits in single session
- If switching between multiple tasks
- If want to ensure artifacts stay current

⚪ **Before Long Break**

- Before lunch break
- Before meetings
- Before context switch
