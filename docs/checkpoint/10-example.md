# Example Walkthrough: T-02-01 Day 3

**Part of**: [Work Session Checkpoint Workflow](../WORK_SESSION_CHECKPOINT_WORKFLOW.md)

This section provides a complete real-world example from T-02-01 Graph Builder, Day 3 (2025-10-27).

---

## Context

**Task**: T-02-01-graph-builder
**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Session**: Day 3 (Export Tracking & Import Parity Resolution)
**Commit**: 3083e00

**Major Achievement**: Import parity resolved from 166/218 (+23.85% variance) to 218/218 (0% exact match)

---

## Step 1: End-of-Session State

**Time**: 2025-10-27 08:20 UTC (session end)

**Situation**:

- Completed major feature (ModuleExports system)
- Made significant commit (3083e00)
- Created daily worklog files (work-summary.md, commit-log.md, notes.md)
- Updated action log with progress

**Problem**: Need to verify all artifacts match actual git changes before EOD

---

## Step 2: Initial Review

**Read Action Log**:

```shell
cat .artifacts/spec-tasks-T-02-01-graph-builder/worklogs/raw/DEVCOOKING-WORK-ACTIONSLOGS-2025-10-27-01.txt
```

**Key Findings**:

- Progress: "Extended graph::builder with full AST-driven export tracking"
- Tests: "Added two focused unit tests"  ← **ISSUE: Actually three tests**
- Parity: "imports now match (218 / 218)"
- Statistics: Present but incomplete

**Check Git Operations**:

```shell
$ git status
On branch feat/task/T-02-01-graph-builder
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/feat/task/T-02-01-graph-builder'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean

$ git log --oneline -3
3083e00 feat(graph): T-02-01 - implement export tracking system and resolve import parity
00da9c2 feat(graph): T-02-01 - add parity harness and refine import resolution
82936fa feat(graph): T-02-01 - implement core graph builder with AST parsing and edge resolution

$ git show --stat 3083e00 | tail -1
 8 files changed, 1361 insertions(+), 64 deletions(-)
```

**Git Ground Truth Recorded**:

- Commit hash: `3083e00`
- Files changed: `8`
- Lines added: `+1,361`
- Lines deleted: `-64`

---

## Step 3: Artifact Review

**Read metadata.yaml**:

```shell
cat .artifacts/spec-tasks-T-02-01-graph-builder/metadata.yaml | grep -A 5 "hash:"
```

**Findings**:

```yaml
- hash: "PENDING"  # ← **ISSUE: Should be 3083e00**
  message: "feat(graph): T-02-01 - implement export tracking system"
  date: "2025-10-27"
  files_changed: 3  # ← **ISSUE: Should be 8**
  notes: "ModuleExports model (+548 lines), 3 new unit tests..."
```

**Read work-summary.md**:

```shell
$ wc -l .artifacts/spec-tasks-T-02-01-graph-builder/worklogs/2025-10-27-work-summary.md
254 2025-10-27-work-summary.md  # ← Good, filled out
```

**Read commit-log.md**:

```shell
cat .artifacts/spec-tasks-T-02-01-graph-builder/worklogs/2025-10-27-commit-log.md | head -20
```

**Findings**:

````markdown
### Commit 1: {COMMIT_HASH_SHORT}  # ← **ISSUE: Template placeholder**

**Message**:
```shell
{COMMIT_MESSAGE}  # ← **ISSUE: Not filled out**
```
````

**Read notes.md**:

```shell
cat .artifacts/spec-tasks-T-02-01-graph-builder/worklogs/2025-10-27-notes.md | head -20
```

**Findings**:

```markdown
### Architecture Decisions

## Step 4: Consistency Matrix

| Metric | Git Actual | metadata.yaml | work-summary | commit-log | notes | action-log | Status |
|--------|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------|-------|------------|--------|
| Commit Hash | 3083e00 | **PENDING** | ✅ | **{PLACEHOLDER}** | N/A | N/A | ❌ |
| Files Changed | 8 | **3** | ✅ | **{PLACEHOLDER}** | N/A | **8** | ❌ |
| Lines Added | +1,361 | 817 | ✅ | **{PLACEHOLDER}** | N/A | +1,361 | ⚠️ |
| Lines Deleted | -64 | 52 | ✅ | **{PLACEHOLDER}** | N/A | -64 | ⚠️ |
| Tests Added | 3 | 3 | ✅ | **{PLACEHOLDER}** | **{PLACEHOLDER}** | **2** | ❌ |

**Issues Identified**:

**Critical**:

1. ❌ metadata.yaml: `hash: "PENDING"` → Should be `"3083e00"`
2. ❌ commit-log.md: Template placeholders not filled
3. ❌ notes.md: Template placeholders not filled

**Important**:
4. ⚠️ metadata.yaml: `files_changed: 3` → Should be `8`
5. ⚠️ action log: Said "two" tests → Should say "three"
6. ⚠️ metadata.yaml: `lines_added: 817` → Should be `1361`

**Consistency Score**: (2 + 2×0.5) / 14 × 100% = **21.4%** ⛔ Critical

---

## Step 5: Fix Critical Issues

**Fix 1: metadata.yaml hash**:

```shell
vim .artifacts/spec-tasks-T-02-01-graph-builder/metadata.yaml
```

**Change**:

```yaml
# Before
- hash: "PENDING"

# After
- hash: "3083e00"
```

**Fix 2: metadata.yaml files_changed**:

```yaml
# Before
files_changed: 3

# After
files_changed: 8
```

**Fix 3: metadata.yaml lines_added/deleted**:

```yaml
# Before
lines_added: 817
lines_deleted: 52

# After
lines_added: 1361
lines_deleted: 64
```

**Fix 4: metadata.yaml notes field**:

```yaml
# Before
notes: "ModuleExports model (+548 lines), 3 new unit tests (+182 lines). Import parity RESOLVED: 0% variance."

# After
notes: "ModuleExports model (+548 lines), 3 new unit tests (+182 lines). Import parity RESOLVED: 0% variance. Invoke variance: +1.9%. Total +1,361 lines, -64 deleted. 8 files: builder.rs, tests, metadata, worklogs, action logs."
```

```text
# Before
- Added two focused unit tests (wildcard_imports_expand_all_exports,
  exports_follow_module_all_aliases) to pin the new behavior.

# After
- Added three focused unit tests (import_edges_follow_package_reexports,
  wildcard_imports_expand_all_exports, exports_follow_module_all_aliases)
  to pin the new behavior. All graph_builder_tests green (6/6 passing).
```

**Fix 8: action log statistics section**:

```text
# Before (no Statistics section, just progress update)

  What's Next

# After (add Statistics section)

  Statistics

  - Files changed: 8 (builder.rs, graph_builder_tests.rs, metadata.yaml, 3 worklogs, 2 action logs)
  - Lines added: +1,361 (code: +730, worklogs: +554, action logs: +135, metadata: +36, deletions: -64)
  - Tests: 3 new unit tests (total 6/6 passing)
  - Test coverage: ~25% (6 unit tests + parity harness)

  What's Next
```

## Step 10: Second Review (Found More Issues!)

**User requested comprehensive consistency check**:

```shell
git status | git log | git diff | git notes
```

**Found**:

- metadata.yaml still had minor discrepancies (lines_added in commits list)
- action log test count still said "two" in one place

**Additional Fixes Applied**:

```shell
$ vim .artifacts/spec-tasks-T-02-01-graph-builder/metadata.yaml
# Updated commit notes with complete file breakdown

$ vim .artifacts/spec-tasks-T-02-01-graph-builder/worklogs/raw/*.txt
# Changed all instances of "two" to "three"
# Added complete Statistics section
```

**Second Checkpoint Commit**:

```shell
git add .artifacts/
git commit -m "fix(worklog): correct Day 3 metadata and action log consistency"
git push origin feat/task/T-02-01-graph-builder
```

---

## Step 11: Final Verification
