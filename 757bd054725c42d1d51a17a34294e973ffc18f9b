T-02-01 Graph Builder - Day Numbering Correction
Timestamp: 2025-10-28T06:29:02Z

## Problem Identified
Incorrect day numbering: Both sessions on 2025-10-28 were labeled inconsistently as "Day 4" and "Day 5"

## Root Cause
Both commits (147b4c2, 956c108) occurred on same date: 2025-10-28
Should both be labeled as "Day 4", not split into Day 4 and Day 5

## Corrected Timeline
- Day 1: 2025-10-24 (2h) - Task initialization
- Day 2: 2025-10-25 (11h) - Core implementation
- Day 3: 2025-10-27 (2.5h) - Export tracking
- Day 4: 2025-10-28 (9h) - Session 1 + Session 2 ← BOTH on same day

## Changes Applied

### metadata.yaml
- actual_hours: 28.5h → 24.5h (corrected calculation)
- Comment labels: "Day 4/Day 5" → "Day 4 Session 1/Session 2"
- Cumulative: 24.5h / 40h estimated
- Remaining: 15.5h (was incorrectly 12h)

### work-summary.md
- "Total Day 5" → "Total Day 4"
- "Day 5 Complete" → "Day 4 Complete"
- "Next Session: Day 6" → "Next Session: Day 5"
- Time tracking section corrected

## Files Changed
2 files: +9 / -9

## Impact
- Restored accurate work calendar
- Fixed cumulative hour calculation
- Corrected remaining hours estimate

## Verification
Date check confirms both commits on 2025-10-28:
- 147b4c2: 2025-10-28 11:48:30
- 956c108: 2025-10-28 12:37:35

## Workflow
Follows WORK_SESSION_CHECKPOINT_WORKFLOW.md Phase 5: Final Verification
