Review 2025-10-23: Verified commit 3549909. Main finding: agent entrypoint was still reading LOG_LEVEL/env vars manually, so new config helper, retry/timeout envs, and request logging toggle had no effect. Updated main.ts to call loadConfig(), wire timeout/retry/logging options, and guard request/response logging behind CDS_ENABLE_REQUEST_LOGGING. Re-ran bun test and bun run typecheck.
