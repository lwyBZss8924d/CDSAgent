Phase: Baseline Stabilization & Diagnostic Infrastructure

Worklog: .artifacts/spec-tasks-T-02-02-sparse-index/worklogs/raw/WORK-SESSIONS-05-THREADS-16-NN-SUMMARY-2025-11-04.txt

Status: VANILLA BASELINE ESTABLISHED

Summary:
- Committed vanilla BM25 configuration (all boosts = None)
- Documented baseline performance: 62.29% global overlap (vs 58.16% Thread-16)
- Proved Thread-16 boosts were NET HARMFUL (+4.13% regression)
- Removed comment extraction overfitting heuristics
- Added infrastructure for future controlled experiments

Baseline Metrics:
- LocAgent: 70.02% | requests: 92.50% | pytest: 64.50%
- django: 53.71% | matplotlib: 58.49% | scikit-learn: 34.51%
- Global: 62.29% (target: 75-85%)

Files: 2 files (+328/-44 lines)
- bm25.rs: Vanilla BM25 with boost infrastructure (unused)
- THREAD-17-BASELINE-ANALYSIS.md: Comprehensive comparative analysis (NEW)

Quality:
- Tests: All passing ✅
- Clippy: Zero warnings ✅
- Coverage: 97.20% maintained

Next Steps:
- Graph parity diagnostics (11-15h)
- Per-query attribution framework (3-5h)
- Env-driven config knobs for experimentation
