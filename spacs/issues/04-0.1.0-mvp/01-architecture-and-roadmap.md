# Issue-01: Architecture & Roadmap Documentation Synthesis

**Priority**: P2 (Integration & Polish - Done Last)
**Status**: ☐ Not Started
**Owner**: Tech Lead + Tech Writer
**PRD Reference**: [PRD-01: System Architecture](../../prd/0.1.0-MVP-PRDs-v0/01-system-architecture.md)

---

## Overview

Synthesize system-level architecture documentation, combining insights from all implementation work into a cohesive narrative that explains CDSAgent's design, rationale, and evolution roadmap.

## Objective

Produce comprehensive architecture documentation that:

- Consolidates technical decisions across all components
- Explains the three-tier architecture (Index, Tools, Agent)
- Documents design principles and tradeoffs
- Provides onboarding material for new team members
- Serves as reference for external stakeholders

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: Collect inputs from all other streams (Issues 02-10)
- **Blocks**: None (documentation deliverable)
- **Timing**: Phase 4 (Week 10) after implementation complete

## Success Metrics Documentation

### Functional Success (PRD-01 §8.1)

- [ ] Document achieved metrics:
  - Can index Python repository and query via CLI
  - Search returns results matching LocAgent's format
  - Traverse produces tree-formatted subgraphs
  - Claude agent executes multi-step code search
  - Hooks inject/compress context successfully

### Performance Success (PRD-01 §8.2)

- [ ] Document achieved metrics:
  - Achieves >80% of LocAgent's accuracy on SWE-bench Lite
