## Objective

Produce clear deployment documentation (daemon + Docker) and troubleshooting guidance to enable teams to stand up CDSAgent in <10 minutes.

## Deliverables

- `deployment/README.md` (quick start)
- `deployment/DAEMON.md` (systemd/launchd setup)
- `deployment/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- `deployment/PRODUCTION.md` (hardening checklist)

## Implementation Steps

1. Record step-by-step instructions for local daemon install, including systemd service file.
2. Document docker-compose workflow with env configuration and logs.
3. Collect common failure modes from QA and add resolution steps.
4. Provide production hardening tips (monitoring, backups, secrets management).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] QA or PM can follow docs to deploy fresh environment without assistance.
- [ ] Troubleshooting section covers at least five real-world issues (e.g., missing index, port conflict).
- [ ] Docs kept in sync with `.env` templates and scripts.
- [ ] Links from root README and `docs/` index.

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite**: [T-07-01](T-07-01-docker-compose.md), [T-07-02](T-07-02-env-config.md), [T-07-03](T-07-03-monitoring.md).
- **Blocks**: Release checklist, onboarding materials.
