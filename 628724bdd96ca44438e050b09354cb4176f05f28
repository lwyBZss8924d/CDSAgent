Status: Session 01 complete - Planning & Analysis phase finished. Corrected metadata.yaml RAW template structure to properly separate Implementation Phases (technical stages) from Work Sessions (actual work periods with threads). Established clear definitions: Session = work period with one RAW log, Thread = continuous work unit within session, Phase = implementation stage.
